Sublime Text 3 ES6 Javascript syntax and snippets

Having a standalone syntax (which actually inherits standard Javadcript syntax) allows to have different set of snippets if you are working with both ES5 and ES6.

Clone this repository to your Packages dir:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oleksiyk/SublimeJavascriptES6.git Javascript ES6
```

Use [SublimeEasySyntax](https://github.com/oleksiyk/SublimeEasySyntax) for project specific syntax (one project is ES5 other is ES6)
